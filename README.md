# Empowering Human-Led Decision Flows with Open Source Models in LangGraph

LangGraph facilitates a unique paradigm: human-led decision flows. Users can guide and influence the actions of LangGraph's AI agents through a four-step process:

User Input: Users initiate interactions with text messages or commands.
Input Processing: The system analyzes the input to understand its context, intent, and instructions.
Execution: Based on the processed input, the system determines the appropriate action or response, which could involve task execution, response generation, or actions tailored to the user's input.
Output: The system delivers its output or response back to the user, such as text messages, information, completed tasks, or feedback.
Benefits of Utilizing Open-Source LLMs with Ollama

While LangGraph traditionally uses OpenAI, integrating open-source LLMs via Ollama offers several advantages:

Customization and Control
Enhanced Privacy and Security
Cost-Effectiveness
Seamless Integration
Specialized Features
Regulatory Compliance
